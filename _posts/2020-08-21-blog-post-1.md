Hi all, this is the very first post in my new research journal - started as a course requirement for INFSCI: 3005 Introduction to Doctoral Studies. I'm a PhD student in the [Intelligent Systems Program](https://www.isp.pitt.edu/ "ISP") at the University of Pittsburgh. My brief introduction can be found [here](https://sanyabt.github.io/). In future, this research journal will include the following posts:

* Recaps of talks attended of varying topics such as machine learning, biomedical informatics and research methods
* Article reviews for any papers I read
* Updates on projects and publications
* Thoughts on my Ph.D. jouney
