Hi! I'm Sanya, a Master's student in the [Intelligent Systems Program](http://www.isp.pitt.edu/ "ISP") at the University of Pittsburgh. I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering in 2018 and decided to pursue my interest in research in Artificial Intelligence. My primary interests include natural language processing, data science, machine learning and more recently, clinical informatics.

I work as a Research Assistant at the Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health at the School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, analyzing real-time Twitter data for public health research involving e-cigarettes and vaping through natural language processing and machine learning techniques using Python and Bridges infrastructure at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC). I also help keep the [RITHM](https://github.com/CRMTH/RITHM "RITHM") software framework documented and up-to-date.

**Technical Skills:** Python, C, C++, Java, HTML, Git, MySQL, Linux environment
