I'm a PhD student in the [Intelligent Systems Program](https://www.isp.pitt.edu/ "ISP") at the University of Pittsburgh, where I previously got my Master's degree (2018-2020). I am currently applying knowledge graphs, ontologies, machine reading and embedding approaches to discover and generate mechanistic hypotheses for pharmacokinetic natural product-drug interactions in the Boyce lab (primary advisor - Dr. Richard Boyce) and at the [NaPDI Center](https://napdicenter.org/). My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation, knowledge graphs and applications of these topics for biomedical discoveries and improving healthcare.

I am a member of the JAMIA Student Editorial Board (2022-2023). I am also a member of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) and the [AMIA student working group (STWG)](https://amia.org/community/working-groups/student), where I contribute to the [STWG newsletter](https://amia.org/community/working-groups/student/student-working-group-newsletter) as the co-editor (2021-present). Previously, I was a part of the University of Pittsburgh Momentum Teaming Grant (2020) to discover associations to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease using machine learning, knowledge graphs and large-scale electronic health records.

My Master's thesis, titled 'Bayesian Network Models with Decision Tree Analysis for Management of Childhood Malaria in Malawi', was completed in April 2020 with Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, Dr. Gerald Douglas and Dr. Gregory Cooper at the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI), University of Pittsburgh. I also worked as a research assistant at the [Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health (MTH)](https://www.crmth.pitt.edu/) at the School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh from September 2018 to February 2020, where we focused on public health research on social media related to vaping, nicotine addiction, anti-vaccination, bot detection and more.
