We created pipelines for processing and classifying real-time data from Twitter related to vaping and e-cigarrettes. Using human-annotated gold standard data for classification of tweets, we compared several machine learning algorithms and classified tweets as relevant and non-relavant; commercial; pro-vape and anti-vape. Tweets were obtained using the RITHM software developed at the Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health (MTH) at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. We collaborated with the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) for the analysis.
